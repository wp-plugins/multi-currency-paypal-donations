<span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; font-size: 11px; white-space: pre-wrap;">PayPal charges high fees for cross border transactions. If you are one of the fortunate few that have paypal accounts in multiple currencies then this plugin is for you. It allows you to route different currencies to specific paypal accounts. Even if you don't have multiple paypal accounts this is still a great plugin for accepting donations.</span>
